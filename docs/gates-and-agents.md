# Gates and agents

Reference for every skill, agent, and command in the plugin: what it does, when it fires, what it reads, what it writes.

For the underlying mechanics (sandbox, output paths, frontmatter), see [architecture.md](architecture.md). For the cycle that strings these together, see [workflow.md](workflow.md).

## Commands (1)

Commands are explicitly-invoked slash commands (`/hyperclaude:<name>`), distinct from description-triggered skills. They are auto-discovered from `commands/*.md`; no manifest entry is required.

### `hyper-setup` — prerequisite doctor

- **Slash:** `/hyperclaude:hyper-setup`
- **Mechanics:** a command (not a skill/gate) that runs one local Node probe (`scripts/setup-doctor.mjs`) via inline bash.
- **Reads:** host environment (Node.js version, `codex` on PATH, `git` on PATH, `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` env var).
- **Writes:** nothing — report only, no `.hyperclaude/` artifact.
- **Use when:** before first use to verify that Node 18+, codex-cli >= 0.130.0, and git are installed; also surfaces whether `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` is set (required by `hyper-plan-loop` and `hyper-implement-loop`).
- **Source:** [commands/hyper-setup.md](../commands/hyper-setup.md).

## Gate skills (8)

A gate skill mediates a step in the cycle that produces a canonical `.hyperclaude/` artifact (or, in the doc-sync case, the doc edits themselves). Four shell out to the Codex bridge directly; `hyper-plan` and `hyper-docs-sync` orchestrate Claude-side work — `hyper-plan` dispatches the `planner` agent, and `hyper-docs-sync` pairs with `hyper-docs-review` for the Codex critic step. `hyper-plan-loop` is a hybrid: it spawns a persistent `planner` teammate for Claude-side revision while calling the bridge directly for each Codex review turn. `hyper-implement-loop` is also a hybrid: it creates the team first (the `TeamCreate` probe is what makes an agent-teams-unavailable host stop as a clean no-op), runs `hyper-implement` (with its optional final code-review suppressed), then spawns a persistent `fixer` teammate — only after implementation finishes — and runs fix rounds against the live `fixer` while calling the bridge directly for each Codex code-review turn.

### `hyper-research` — pre-implementation research

- **Slash:** `/hyperclaude:hyper-research <task description>`
- **Paths:** two execution paths (Codex + Claude); selection is a plain-language rule — **not** a flag/token parser.
  - **Default — both in parallel:** a normal invocation runs the Codex `research` mode (Codex `exec`, read-only sandbox) AND dispatches the [`researcher`](#researcher) agent (backgrounded), producing two artifacts that share one frontmatter `slug:`.
  - **Single path:** only on an explicit request — "Codex only / no Claude" → Codex alone; "Claude only / Claude-native / no-Codex / second opinion" → Claude alone. The Claude path uses `WebFetch` on known URLs — it does NOT provide web-search parity with the Codex `--search` path.
- **Reads:** the task text passed by the user (or read from a temp file).
- **Writes:** by default a pair — `.hyperclaude/research/<timestamp>-<slug>.md` (Codex) + `.hyperclaude/research/<timestamp>-<slug>-claude.md` (Claude) — both with the same always-present frontmatter keys, the same `slug:`, and the same section structure (`Prior Art`, `Pitfalls`, `Recommendations`). The Claude artifact omits Codex-only conditional keys and records `codex-version: claude` to distinguish it from a Codex-authored artifact. A single-path run writes only the one corresponding file.
- **Use when:** about to design a non-trivial change and you want prior art / failure modes before committing to an approach.
- **Skip when:** the task is one-line / mechanical / well-trodden.
- **`--resume`:** not supported (research is not iterative).
- **Source:** [skills/hyper-research/SKILL.md](../skills/hyper-research/SKILL.md), template [templates/codex/research.md](../templates/codex/research.md).

### `hyper-plan` — Claude plan generator

- **Slash:** `/hyperclaude:hyper-plan [task]`
- **Mechanics:** *not* a Codex gate. The skill resolves the task (from `$ARGUMENTS`, or the latest research file's `task:` frontmatter), derives or reuses a slug, and dispatches the [`planner`](#planner) agent. The planner returns a multi-task markdown plan; the skill writes it verbatim to `.hyperclaude/plans/<timestamp>-<slug>.md`.
- **Writes:** `.hyperclaude/plans/<timestamp>-<slug>.md` — plain markdown (no frontmatter), with `## Task N: <title>` sections that `/hyperclaude:hyper-implement` consumes directly.
- **Slug:** reused from the matching `hyper-research` artifact's `slug:` when one exists, so the `research → plan → plan-review` trio shares one slug. Otherwise derived from task text (lowercase, ASCII, ≤5 words, kebab-case).
- **`--resume`:** not supported — re-plan by re-running with a refined task.
- **Use when:** about to start multi-task work and you want a plan `/hyperclaude:hyper-plan-review` can critique and `/hyperclaude:hyper-implement` can execute.
- **Skip when:** the task is one step (dispatch `implementer` directly); a recent plan already covers it.
- **Source:** [skills/hyper-plan/SKILL.md](../skills/hyper-plan/SKILL.md). No template — the skill prompts the agent inline.

### `hyper-plan-review` — Codex plan critique

- **Slash:** `/hyperclaude:hyper-plan-review [path/to/plan.md]`
  - `--resume` — resume the most recent matching prior review (auto-discovers newest artifact in `.hyperclaude/plan-reviews/` with same mode + cwd + plan-path; falls back to fresh run if none found, records `codex-resume-status: fallback`).
  - `--resume <prev-artifact-path>` — resume from an explicit prior review; validation fail → `ok:false`, no fresh run.
- **Mode:** `plan-review` (Codex `exec`, read-only sandbox).
- **Auto-discovers:** the most recent file under `.hyperclaude/plans/` if no path is passed.
- **Reads:** the plan markdown.
- **Writes:** `.hyperclaude/plan-reviews/<timestamp>-<slug>.md` — Issues (Blocker / Major / Minor), Improvements, and Verdict. Frontmatter records `codex-resume-status`: one of `fresh | resumed | fallback | resume-failed`.
- **Slug:** reused from the plan filename, so the research → plan → plan-review trio shares one slug for traceability.
- **Use when:** Claude has written a plan and you want Codex to find blockers before execution.
- **Source:** [skills/hyper-plan-review/SKILL.md](../skills/hyper-plan-review/SKILL.md), template [templates/codex/plan-review.md](../templates/codex/plan-review.md).

### `hyper-plan-loop` — autonomous plan-revise loop

- **Slash:** `/hyperclaude:hyper-plan-loop [task]`
- **Mechanics:** team-based revise loop. The skill spawns the [`planner`](#planner) agent once as a persistent team teammate (requires `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`). The lead resolves the plan path and instructs the planner teammate to write the plan file itself at that path (caller-directed write-file mode); the planner replies `WROTE: <path>` only and idles between turns. The lead then runs Codex `plan-review` directly via the bridge, sends the critique back to the planner teammate via SendMessage, and repeats until the review reports no Blocker or Major issues, or the 5 severity-gated-review cap is reached (a final Minor-cleanup re-review may additionally run once, outside that cap). When only a concrete actionable Minor remains, the loop runs exactly one final cleanup revision and one resumed re-review then hard-stops to teardown — it never recurses on Minor; if that re-review introduces a new Blocker or Major it does not re-revise but reports a terminal revise-regression state. The reviewer is always the Codex bridge — NOT a team agent — preserving the "Claude builds, Codex reviews" invariant.
- **Writes:** `.hyperclaude/plans/<timestamp>-<slug>.md` (same-path overwrite on each revise); `.hyperclaude/plan-reviews/<timestamp>-<slug>.md` per iteration.
- **`--resume`:** `--resume auto` is passed to `plan-review` from iteration 2 onward (threads the Codex review session for token efficiency).
- **Use when:** you want a fully autonomous plan-research → plan → review → revise cycle in one gesture. Requires the experimental agent-teams Claude Code feature.
- **Skip when:** you prefer manual control over each revise turn (use `hyper-plan` + `hyper-plan-review` instead — both remain available and untouched).
- **Source:** [skills/hyper-plan-loop/SKILL.md](../skills/hyper-plan-loop/SKILL.md).

### `hyper-implement-loop` — autonomous implement-hardening loop

- **Slash:** `/hyperclaude:hyper-implement-loop [path/to/plan.md]`
- **Mechanics:** team-based implement-hardening loop. The skill creates the team FIRST via the `TeamCreate` probe (requires `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`; an unavailable host therefore stops as a clean no-op before any tree mutation). The lead runs `hyper-implement` to completion (boundary A — full plan execution; hyper-implement's optional final code-review step is suppressed so the loop's first review is the single authoritative one), then — only after implementation finishes — spawns the [`fixer`](#fixer) agent once as a persistent teammate (spawning earlier buys no context, since hyper-implement builds with its own fresh subagents the fixer never observes), then invokes Codex `code-review --base main` directly via the bridge for that first review, sends blocking findings to the still-live fixer via SendMessage, and repeats until no blocking findings remain (judged semantically — correctness/data-loss/security/broken-build/regression/missing-behavior block; style/nits do not) or a 3-review cap is reached. The reviewer is always the Codex bridge — NOT a team agent — preserving the "Claude builds, Codex reviews" invariant.
- **Writes:** implementation files (via `hyper-implement`); `.hyperclaude/code-reviews/<timestamp>-vs-main.md` per iteration (release-level slug derived from the diff target, not the plan).
- **`--resume`:** `--resume auto` is passed to `code-review` from iteration 2 onward.
- **Cap:** 3 total Codex reviews (1 fresh + at most 2 resumed fix rounds). On cap-reached with open findings, emits a named cap report and tears down.
- **Fix-validation gate:** semantic finding-map check — every cited blocking finding must map to `status: fixed` OR `status: not-applicable` with a non-empty `notes:` reason. No git-state / no-op gate (a stuck fixer is bounded by the cap).
- **Teardown:** mandatory on every exit path after teammate spawn — `SendMessage shutdown_request` → `TeamDelete`.
- **Use when:** you want a fully autonomous implement → code-review → fix cycle in one gesture. Requires the experimental agent-teams Claude Code feature.
- **Skip when:** you prefer manual control over each implement / review round (use `hyper-implement` + `hyper-code-review` instead — both remain available and untouched); or the task is one step (use `hyper-implement` directly); or the experimental agent-teams feature is unavailable.
- **Source:** [skills/hyper-implement-loop/SKILL.md](../skills/hyper-implement-loop/SKILL.md).

### `hyper-code-review` — Codex code review

- **Slash:** `/hyperclaude:hyper-code-review [target]`
  - Empty → branch diff vs `main`.
  - `uncommitted` → staged + unstaged + untracked.
  - 7–40 hex chars → that specific commit.
  - `vs <ref>` → branch diff vs that ref.
- **Mode:** `code-review` (fresh: Codex `exec --sandbox read-only -` with a prompt template, same spawn shape as the other fresh modes; resumed: `codex exec resume … -c sandbox_mode=read-only`).
- **Writes:** `.hyperclaude/code-reviews/<timestamp>-<slug>.md` — Codex's findings (`### Findings` Blocker/Major/Minor + `### Verdict`), with frontmatter recording `codex-thread-id`, `template-version`, `cwd`, `git-head`, and (depending on target) `base-ref`, `commit`, or the optional `title`. Frontmatter records `codex-resume-status` (one of `fresh | resumed | fallback | resume-failed`); on a successful resume, `codex-resumed-from` records the prior artifact path. The `uncommitted` target has no dedicated frontmatter field; it's identifiable from `slug: uncommitted` and the heading.
- **Base target scope:** for `--base <ref>`, Codex reviews the *effective worktree vs base* — committed-since-base (`git diff <ref>...HEAD`) PLUS the uncommitted overlay (`git diff`, `git diff --cached`, untracked files). This is deliberate: `hyper-implement-loop` re-runs `code-review --base main --resume auto` after the fixer leaves edits uncommitted, so the base target must cover that overlay (see [decisions.md](decisions.md)). `--commit <sha>` reads the historical commit; `--uncommitted` reads the working-tree overlay only.
- **`--resume`:** auto-discovers the most recent matching prior review under `.hyperclaude/code-reviews/` (same base ref NAME / commit SHA / uncommitted state); explicit path validation enforces target identity match. Mismatch → `ok:false`, no fresh fallback. Status taxonomy: `fresh | resumed | fallback | resume-failed`. Note: `--base <ref>` matches by ref NAME (not resolved SHA; pinning SHA would force resume to review a stale diff). `--commit <sha>` matches by exact SHA. `--uncommitted` by symmetric absence of both `base-ref` and `commit` keys. Additionally, the prior artifact must carry a `template-version` matching the current code-review prompt: a legacy artifact from the old native `codex exec review` path is not resumable — `--resume auto` falls back to fresh (`fallback`), explicit `--resume <legacy-path>` returns `ok:false` with `resume rejected`.
- **Use when:** post-implementation, before shipping a release, before opening a PR.
- **Source:** [skills/hyper-code-review/SKILL.md](../skills/hyper-code-review/SKILL.md). Fresh runs use [templates/codex/code-review.md](../templates/codex/code-review.md) (substitutes `{{TARGET_INSTRUCTION}}`; Codex runs the target git commands itself under the read-only sandbox). Resumed runs use [templates/codex/code-review-resumed.md](../templates/codex/code-review-resumed.md) (substitutes `{{TARGET_INSTRUCTION}}` so the resumed `UserTurn` re-fetches the diff explicitly).

### `hyper-docs-sync` — Claude doc-sync orchestrator

- **Slash:** `/hyperclaude:hyper-docs-sync [target]` — same target contract as `hyper-code-review` (empty / `uncommitted` / commit SHA / `vs <ref>`).
- **Mechanics:** *not* a Codex gate. The skill resolves changed files via git, reads a `Code | Docs` mapping table from `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` (or falls back to filename heuristics), aggregates per-doc, and dispatches the [`documenter`](#documenter) agent once per affected doc.
- **Writes:** the doc edits themselves (no `.hyperclaude/` artifact). New docs are scaffolded in CREATE mode; existing docs edited in UPDATE mode.
- **Use when:** after non-trivial implementation that changed documented behavior (API, schemas, CLI flags, architecture).
- **Confidence rule:** dispatches the agent only when the mapping table matches OR the changed file's stem appears in the doc filename. Lower-confidence candidates are surfaced in the report as "skipped — possible candidates" so the user can decide.
- **Source:** [skills/hyper-docs-sync/SKILL.md](../skills/hyper-docs-sync/SKILL.md).

### `hyper-docs-review` — Codex doc accuracy gate

- **Slash:** `/hyperclaude:hyper-docs-review [path] [--diff-base <ref>] [--resume [<artifact>]]` — argument order is `path → --diff-base → --resume`. `path` defaults to `docs/` when omitted, so `/hyperclaude:hyper-docs-review --diff-base main` is valid (reviews `docs/` against the diff).
  - Empty → top-level `.md` files in `docs/` (commentarium convention).
  - Single file → reviews that file.
  - Directory → reviews top-level `.md` files in that dir (recursion deferred — see [decisions.md](decisions.md)).
  - `--resume` — resume the most recent matching prior review (auto-discovers newest artifact in `.hyperclaude/docs-reviews/` with same docs-target + diff-base; falls back to fresh run if none found, records `codex-resume-status: fallback`).
  - `--resume <prev-artifact-path>` — resume from an explicit prior review; validation fail → `ok:false`, no fresh run. If docs payload exceeds 200KB on a resume run, bridge returns `ok:false` (no fallback — user must narrow scope).
- **Mode:** `docs-review` (Codex `exec`, read-only sandbox).
- **Writes:** `.hyperclaude/docs-reviews/<timestamp>-<slug>.md` — Findings, Gaps, Broken Or Suspect Links, Cross-Doc Inconsistencies, and Verdict. Scope is strict: *accuracy / drift / completeness / broken links / contradictions* (NOT prose / style — that is the documenter agent's job). Frontmatter records `codex-resume-status`: one of `fresh | resumed | fallback | resume-failed`.
- **Size guards:** docs payload ≤ 200KB; with `--diff-base`, diff ≤ 500KB.
- **Use when:** after `hyper-docs-sync`, or any time a documentation accuracy gate is wanted.
- **Source:** [skills/hyper-docs-review/SKILL.md](../skills/hyper-docs-review/SKILL.md), template [templates/codex/docs-review.md](../templates/codex/docs-review.md).

### Distinction at a glance

| Skill | Who acts | What is reviewed |
|---|---|---|
| `hyper-research` | Codex + Claude (`researcher` agent) in parallel by default; single path on explicit request | (a future) task description |
| `hyper-plan` | Claude (via `planner` agent) | task → plan generation, no review |
| `hyper-plan-review` | Codex | Claude's plan |
| `hyper-plan-loop` | Claude (persistent planner teammate) + Codex (bridge) | autonomous plan-revise loop; reviewer is always Codex |
| `hyper-implement-loop` | Claude (`hyper-implement` + persistent fixer teammate) + Codex (bridge) | autonomous implement-hardening loop; reviewer is always Codex |
| `hyper-code-review` | Codex | a code diff |
| `hyper-docs-sync` | Claude (via `documenter` agent) | edits docs to match code |
| `hyper-docs-review` | Codex | docs (optionally with code-diff context) |

## Helper skills (3)

Helper skills shape Claude's behavior on tasks. They are not Codex gates themselves and don't directly produce `.hyperclaude/` artifacts. (`hyper-implement` may chain into `/hyperclaude:hyper-code-review` during its final pass — that nested gate writes a `.hyperclaude/code-reviews/` file via the regular gate path, but the helper skill itself doesn't.)

### `hyper-implement` — plan execution loop

- **Slash:** `/hyperclaude:hyper-implement [path/to/plan.md]`
- **What it does:** reads a plan, dispatches a fresh subagent per task, runs two reviews (spec compliance via a general-purpose subagent, then code quality via another), and only marks the task complete when both pass.
- **Feature branch + per-task commits:** before the task loop it creates/switches to `hyper/<slug>` when on `main`/`master` (the protected default branch; an already-checked-out non-default branch is respected as-is). After both reviews pass, the **lead** (never the implementer) commits the task with the plan's per-task conventional-commit message. A task with no file changes is skipped (no empty commit). Everything is local — the skill never pushes the branch or a tag.
- **Agents used:** [`implementer`](#implementer), [`verifier`](#verifier) (for tests / acceptance), and ad-hoc general-purpose subagents for the two reviews.
- **Why fresh subagents:** v0.1 dogfooding (the 11-task plan that built v0.1, ~33 subagent dispatches) showed that reusing a single subagent across tasks pollutes context and degrades focus. The skill enforces fresh dispatch per task.
- **Final pass:** runs whatever the plan defines as final acceptance (e.g. `bash scripts/test/smoke.sh` for hyperclaude itself) and, if available, `/hyperclaude:hyper-code-review` after the last task.
- **Skip when:** the plan is one step, tasks are tightly coupled, or you're prototyping fast.
- **Source:** [skills/hyper-implement/SKILL.md](../skills/hyper-implement/SKILL.md).

### `hyper-tdd` — test-driven discipline

- **What it does:** enforces a tight TDD loop — fail first, minimal pass, refactor, repeat.
- **Use when:** about to write or modify behavior-bearing code (functions, modules, business logic).
- **Skip when:** pure config edits, doc-only changes, one-shot scripts where tests would not outlive the change.
- **Source:** [skills/hyper-tdd/SKILL.md](../skills/hyper-tdd/SKILL.md).

### `hyper-debug` — debugging discipline

- **What it does:** systematic debugging — reproduce, isolate, instrument, root-cause.
- **Use when:** something is unexpectedly broken and the cause is not obvious.
- **Skip when:** "I know what's wrong" one-line fixes.
- **Source:** [skills/hyper-debug/SKILL.md](../skills/hyper-debug/SKILL.md).

## Implementation-arm agents (6)

Agents are sub-Claude personas with restricted tool sets. They are dispatched by skills (or by Claude directly when the skill rules don't apply). Each `<name>.md` in [agents/](../agents/) carries the prompt and the allowed tool list.

### `planner`

- **Tools:** `Read, Glob, Grep, Bash, WebFetch, Write`. In caller-directed write-file mode (used only by `hyper-plan-loop`), the planner writes the plan file itself at the lead-resolved path. In the standard flow (`hyper-plan`), the planner returns the plan body and the skill owns the Write.
- **Job:** decompose a task into ordered, bite-sized steps with file paths and per-step verification checks. Produces a numbered plan, typically saved to `.hyperclaude/plans/<timestamp>-<slug>.md` for `hyper-plan-review` to consume.
- **Source:** [agents/planner.md](../agents/planner.md).

### `implementer`

- **Tools:** `Read, Edit, Write, Glob, Grep, Bash`.
- **Job:** carry out one planned step. Returns a description of what was changed plus the diff. Used by `hyper-implement` once per task; can also be dispatched directly when the user already has a clear single step.
- **Source:** [agents/implementer.md](../agents/implementer.md).

### `fixer`

- **Tools:** `Read, Edit, Write, Glob, Grep, Bash`.
- **Job:** apply ONLY the Codex code-review findings explicitly cited in each `SendMessage` from the lead. Re-reads current diff/files each round (context may be stale across rounds), makes the minimum targeted fix per finding, runs relevant verification, and replies with the structured per-finding schema (`finding:` / `status:` / `files-changed:` / `verification:` / `notes:`); the spawning `hyper-implement-loop` skill directs that reply back to the lead via `SendMessage` (transport is skill-injected, not part of this agent definition). There is no canonical output file — the fixer edits in place.
- **Constraints:** fix ONLY cited findings — no opportunistic refactors, no scope expansion; NEVER commit or push; NEVER invoke codex or `scripts/codex-bridge.mjs`; never act as reviewer. Spotting additional issues beyond the cited findings is noted in `notes:` only, not acted on.
- **Dispatched by:** `hyper-implement-loop` — spawned once as a persistent team teammate; every fix round reuses its retained context via SendMessage.
- **Source:** [agents/fixer.md](../agents/fixer.md).

### `verifier`

- **Tools:** `Read, Bash, Glob, Grep`. No edit tools — verifier never modifies files.
- **Job:** run tests, check the actual file/command output, report PASS / PARTIAL / FAIL with verbatim output. Used by `hyper-implement` after the implementer claims a step is done.
- **Source:** [agents/verifier.md](../agents/verifier.md).

### `documenter`

- **Tools:** `Read, Edit, Write, Glob, Grep, Bash`.
- **Job:** edit a documentation file in-place to reflect code changes (UPDATE mode), or scaffold a new file from a code path (CREATE mode). Minimal edits, no scope creep, no prose polish. Receives target path, aggregated diff/excerpts, and mapping rationale from `hyper-docs-sync`.
- **Source:** [agents/documenter.md](../agents/documenter.md).

### `researcher`

- **Tools:** `Read, Glob, Grep, Bash, WebFetch`.
- **Job:** produce a Prior Art / Pitfalls / Recommendations research artifact for a task description, using `WebFetch` on known URLs. **Not** a web-search substitute — `WebFetch` fetches known URLs; it does not replicate the live crawl that Codex performs via `--search`. Writes the same always-present `.hyperclaude/research/` frontmatter keys and section structure as the Codex path, with `codex-version: claude` to mark it as Claude-authored.
- **Dispatched by:** `hyper-research` — on the default parallel run (backgrounded, alongside the Codex bridge) AND on an explicit Claude-only / no-Codex / second-opinion request.
- **Source:** [agents/researcher.md](../agents/researcher.md).
